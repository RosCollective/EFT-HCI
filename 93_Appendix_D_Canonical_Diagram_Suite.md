# Appendix D — Canonical Diagram Suite for EFT–HCI


## D.1 Overview of Diagrammatic Formalism

Diagrammatic objects in Ecological Field Theory of Hybrid Cognitive Intelligence
(EFT–HCI) represent tensor fields, operator flows, curvature behavior, phase
structure, and energetic distributions in compressed geometric form.

Each diagram type corresponds to a canonical mathematical object:

    • Free-body diagrams     → ecological force tensors
    • Ray diagrams           → information/resonance propagation
    • Circuit diagrams       → constraint-resonance flow networks
    • Motion graphs          → ecological trajectories
    • P–V diagrams           → pressure–volume ecological analogues
    • Sankey diagrams        → resonance/energy distribution
    • Phase-space diagrams   → attractor structure
    • Critical-manifold diagrams → degeneracy surfaces
    • Bifurcation diagrams   → topological phase transitions
    • Operator-flow diagrams → Heisenberg evolution
    • Spectral-geometry plots → eigenvalue structure of D̂

All diagrams correspond to formal tensor or operator equations.


## D.2 Free-Body Diagrams (Ecological Force Representation)

Represents ecological force balance on manifold regions.

Mathematical object:

    F_μ = ℛ_μ + Δ_μ + K_μ

where:

    ℛ_μ   — curvature force contribution
    Δ_μ   — constraint divergence force
    K_μ   — resonance–identity coupling term

Diagram components:

    • Arrows: tensor directions of F_μ
    • Node: ecological subsystem under analysis
    • Boundary frame: local patch of 𝓜_E

Interpretation:

A free-body diagram encodes local tensor contributions governing evolution
of x^μ(s) under ecological geodesic deviation equations.


## D.3 Ray Diagrams (Resonance/Information Propagation)

Represents ecological “lightlike” propagation of resonance.

Mathematical analogue:

    k_μ k^μ = 0   (null-resonance condition)

where k_μ = ∇_μΦ describes resonance gradient flow.

Diagram components:

    • Rays: integral curves of Φ_μ
    • Interfaces: discontinuities in Λ_{μν}
    • Nodes: identity-gradient intersections

Interpretation:

Ray diagrams depict how resonance propagates through constraint geometry,
analogous to optical paths governed by refractive index n(x) → Λ_{μν}(x).


## D.4 Circuit Diagrams (Constraint-Resonance Flow)

Represents conserved or semi-conserved flow through ecological subsystems.

Mathematical formulation:

    ∮ J_μ dx^μ = constant

where the ecological current J_μ is:

    J_μ = Φ_μ Ψ + Λ_{μν} Φ^ν

Diagram elements:

    • Resistors → constraint barriers Λ
    • Capacitors → resonance wells Φ
    • Inductors → torsion loops T
    • Sources → identity pumps Ψ

Interpretation:

Circuit diagrams encode steady-state or cyclic flows in hybrid cognition.


##  D.5 Motion Graphs (State Trajectories)

Plots ecological variables against system evolution parameter s.

Typical forms:

    • x(s)
    • dx/ds
    • curvature ℛ(s)
    • resonance amplitude |Φ|(s)

Motion graphs reflect geodesic or perturbed-geodesic motion:

    d²x^μ/ds² + Γ^μ_{νσ}(dx^ν/ds)(dx^σ/ds) = F^μ

where F^μ includes ecological forces from D.2.

Interpretation:

Motion graphs visualize how a point of cognition evolves across the manifold.


## D.6 P-V Diagrams (Ecological Pressure-Volume Analogue)

Define ecological pressure P_E and ecological volume V_E:

    P_E = Tr(Λ²)
    V_E = ∫ dV √|g|

Diagram axes:

    (V_E, P_E)

Interpretation:

Used to diagnose compression, expansion, collapse, and phase transitions
where:

    ∂P_E/∂V_E → ∞

indicates criticality.


## D.7 Sankey Diagrams (Energy / Resonance Distribution)

Represents magnitude-weighted flows of ecological quantities.

Quantities represented:

    E_res = |Φ|²
    E_id  = |∇Ψ|²
    E_con = |Λ|²
    E_geo = |ℛ|

Flow width ∝ magnitude.

Interpretation:

Sankey diagrams visualize redistribution of energy among sectors during
collapse, reconstitution, or symmetry breaking.


## D.8 Phase-Space Diagrams (Attractor Structure)

Coordinates:

    (Ψ, Φ_μ) or (Ψ, Λ_{μν}) or dimension-reduced (Ψ, Φ)

Flow defined by:

    dX/ds = F(X)

Attractors:

    • Fixed points → F = 0
    • Wells → negative eigenvalues of Jacobian
    • Tori → quasi-periodic flow
    • Collapse → |X| → ∞

Interpretation:

Phase-space diagrams classify hybrid-cognitive attractors.


## D.9 Critical-Manifold Diagrams (Metric Degeneracy Surfaces)

Critical surfaces defined by:

    det(g_{μν}) = 0

Diagram elements:

    • Boundary surface where ξ → ∞
    • Regions shaded by curvature sign
    • Trajectories approaching degeneracy

Interpretation:

Visualizes metric collapse and ecological criticality.


## D.10 Bifurcation Diagrams (Topological Transitions)

Plot order parameter Σ or curvature ℛ vs. control parameter λ.

Bifurcation occurs when:

    ∂F/∂X = 0
    det(∂²F/∂X²) = 0

Types:

    • Saddle-node
    • Transcritical
    • Pitchfork
    • Hopf
    • Cusp

Interpretation:

Represents ecological phase transitions described in Chapters 12 and 13.


## D.11 Operator Flow Diagrams (Heisenberg Evolution)

Depict evolution:

    dX̂/ds = i[Ĥ_Eco, X̂]

Diagram nodes = operators X̂  
Arrows = commutator-induced flow  
Weights = magnitude of change ||dX̂/ds||

Interpretation:

Encodes operator coupling strength and dynamical instability.


## D.12 Spectral Geometry Diagrams (D Eigenvalue Structure)

Plots eigenvalues λ_n of Dirac operator D̂.

Key structures:

    • Asymptotic slope → dimensionality
    • Gaps → phase states
    • Bands → toroidal resonance
    • Divergence → collapse

Interpretation:

Spectral diagrams diagnose topology, curvature, and collapse risk.
