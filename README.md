# Ecological Field Theory of Hybrid Cognitive Intelligence (EFT–HCI)

Ecological Field Theory of Hybrid Cognitive Intelligence (EFT–HCI) is a theoretical work that introduces a mathematical ecology for modeling hybrid cognitive systems. It treats human–system interaction as a dynamical field governed by constraints, resonance, and stability–collapse behavior, and develops a unified formalism using manifolds, tensor fields, and operator dynamics.

This work is intended for readers with backgrounds in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, complex systems, applied mathematics, or related fields. It assumes familiarity with formal modeling and does not present introductory material, tutorials, or applied implementations.

EFT–HCI is released as an open theoretical contribution. It is not a product specification, software framework, or applied methodology, but a foundational model designed to support independent analysis, critical evaluation, and future theoretical development.
