# Ecological Field Theory of Hybrid Cognitive Intelligence (EFT–HCI)

Ecological Field Theory of Hybrid Cognitive Intelligence (EFT–HCI) is a theoretical work that introduces a mathematical ecology for modeling hybrid cognitive systems. It treats human–system interaction as a dynamical field governed by constraints, resonance, and stability–collapse behavior, and develops a unified formalism using manifolds, tensor fields, and operator dynamics.

This work is intended for readers with backgrounds in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, complex systems, applied mathematics, or related fields. It assumes familiarity with formal modeling and does not present introductory material, tutorials, or applied implementations.

EFT–HCI is released as an open theoretical contribution. It is not a product specification, software framework, or applied methodology, but a foundational model designed to support independent analysis, critical evaluation, and future theoretical development.

## How to Read This Book

This work is a theoretical framework, not a tutorial or introductory text. It is written for readers comfortable with formal reasoning, abstraction, and mathematical language, and it does not attempt to ease the reader in gradually.

It is not necessary to read this book linearly. The early chapters establish the conceptual and formal foundations of Ecological Field Theory of Hybrid Cognitive Intelligence, while later chapters explore structural consequences, stability regimes, and open problems. Readers may wish to begin with sections aligned to their background and return to earlier material as needed.

The appendices provide formal detail, operator definitions, and derivations that support the main text. They are intended as reference material rather than required reading on a first pass.

This work is designed to be engaged with iteratively: read, pause, reflect, and return. Skimming is not only acceptable—it is often appropriate.
