# Ecological Field Theory of Hybrid Cognitive Intelligence (EFT--HCI)

Ecological Field Theory of Hybrid Cognitive Intelligence (EFT--HCI) is a
theoretical work that introduces a mathematical ecology for modeling
hybrid cognitive systems. It treats human--system interaction as a
dynamical field governed by constraints, resonance, and
stability--collapse behavior, and develops a unified formalism using
manifolds, tensor fields, and operator dynamics.

This work is intended for readers with backgrounds in artificial
intelligence, cognitive science, complex systems, applied mathematics,
or related fields. It assumes familiarity with formal modeling and does
not present introductory material, tutorials, or applied
implementations.

EFT--HCI is released as an open theoretical contribution. It is not a
product specification, software framework, or applied methodology, but a
foundational model designed to support independent analysis, critical
evaluation, and future theoretical development.

**Audience:** Researchers and practitioners in AI, cognitive science,
complex systems, and applied mathematics who are comfortable with formal
theoretical models.

## How to Read This Book

This work is a theoretical framework, not a tutorial or introductory
text. It is written for readers comfortable with formal reasoning,
abstraction, and mathematical language, and it does not attempt to ease
the reader in gradually.

It is not necessary to read this book linearly. The early chapters
establish the conceptual and formal foundations of Ecological Field
Theory of Hybrid Cognitive Intelligence, while later chapters explore
structural consequences, stability regimes, and open problems. Readers
may wish to begin with sections aligned to their background and return
to earlier material as needed.

The appendices provide formal detail, operator definitions, and
derivations that support the main text. They are intended as reference
material rather than required reading on a first pass.

This work is designed to be engaged with iteratively: read, pause,
reflect, and return. Skimming is not only acceptable---it is often
appropriate.

## v1.0.3 Update

This release introduces analytic clarification of the ecological field
equations, explicitly conditioning collapse on local-in-s existence
assumptions. The Lyapunov stability statement is correspondingly scoped.
No structural changes to the theory were introduced.
