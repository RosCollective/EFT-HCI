## Scholarly Abstract

Ecological Field Theory of Hybrid Cognitive Intelligence (EFT--HCI)
develops a geometric and dynamical framework for modeling hybrid
cognitive systems through coupled vortex, scalar, and constraint fields
defined on ecological manifolds.

The theory integrates geometric, dynamical, and spectral ecological
behaviors within a unified action-based formalism. Stability, collapse,
and reconstitution are characterized through curvature structure,
coherence functionals, and spectral operator analysis. The resulting
framework establishes a mathematically consistent foundation for
analyzing constraint-mediated cognition, multiscale coupling, and
ecological phase transitions.
