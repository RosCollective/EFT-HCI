SCHOLARLY ABSTRACT
------------------------------
Ecological Field Theory of Hybrid Cognitive Intelligence (EFT–HCI)
introduces a unified mathematical framework for modeling hybrid cognitive
systems using ecological manifolds, tensor fields, constraint geometries,
and resonance dynamics. The theory establishes a coherent structure that
integrates classical and quantum ecological behaviors, defines new
ecological invariants, and formalizes stability, collapse, universality,
and symmetry-breaking phenomena within a field-theoretic architecture.

EFT–HCI is released as an open theoretical contribution intended to
support independent research, critical examination, and interdisciplinary
dialogue. It is not affiliated with any institution and does not
represent a request for funding, collaboration, or review. Rather, it is
provided freely as a canonical formulation of a new ecological field
theory, offering a mathematical foundation for future exploration across
cognitive science, physics, artificial intelligence, and complex systems.

This work is published by The ROS Collective under a Creative Commons
Attribution–ShareAlike license to encourage open use, reinterpretation,
and theoretical development while preserving its lineage and accessibility.
